        "Clean the Coop Regularly: Cleaning your chicken coop at least once a week is essential to maintain a healthy environment. Remove the old bedding, wash the feeders, and ventilate the coop.",
        "Proper Feeding: Chickens thrive on a balanced diet of grains, greens, and calcium (like crushed shells or chalk). Avoid moldy food and sugary treats, as they can harm your chickens.",
        "Hydration is Key: Always ensure that your chickens have access to fresh water throughout the day. Dehydration can seriously impact their egg production.",
        "Prevent Parasites with Sand Baths: To protect your chickens from lice and mites, provide them with sand baths. Adding wood ash to the sand will boost its effectiveness.",
        "Egg Collection Routine: Collect eggs twice daily—morning and evening. Use a soft container for storage to avoid damaging them and store them at a temperature between 10-15°C.",
        "Light for Egg Production: In winter, providing 14 hours of light per day will help maintain egg production. In summer, make sure they have some shade to stay comfortable.",
        "Know When to Call the Vet: If your chickens show signs of lethargy, lack of appetite, diarrhea, or abnormal behavior like rare cackling, it's time to call the vet.",
        "Keep the Coop Disinfected: Once a month, disinfect the coop using safe cleaning agents. Before doing so, remove all organic materials, such as bedding and feed.",
        "During Molting: Molting is a natural process, but make sure to add extra protein and vitamins to your chickens' diet to help them recover and regain their feathers.",
        "Safety from Predators: Regularly check your fence, netting, and locks to keep predators out. Chickens should only be let out during the day and should be locked up safely at night.",
        "Monitor for Egg Production Issues: If egg production drops unexpectedly, check for stressors such as inadequate lighting, improper diet, or pests in the coop.",
        "Clean the Roosts: Regularly disinfect the roosts, especially during the rainy season, to avoid the growth of bacteria, fungus, or mold that can harm your chickens.",
        "Be Careful with Bread: While bread may seem like a treat, it is best to avoid giving it to your chickens. It can affect their digestion and may lead to health problems over time.",
        "Use Safe Cleaning Products: When disinfecting your chicken coop, always use non-toxic, safe cleaning products such as vinegar or specialized agents designed for farm use."
